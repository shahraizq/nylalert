# Security Measures Implemented

## 🔐 Security Enhancements

### 1. Input Validation
- ✅ All configuration values are validated on startup
- ✅ Solana addresses are validated using PublicKey checks
- ✅ URLs are validated and restricted to allowed domains
- ✅ Numeric values have bounds checking
- ✅ Transaction data is sanitized before processing

### 2. Sensitive Data Protection
- ✅ API keys and webhook URLs are masked in logs
- ✅ Wallet addresses are truncated in logs (first 4...last 4)
- ✅ Environment variables used for all secrets
- ✅ `.gitignore` updated to prevent credential leaks

### 3. Rate Limiting
- ✅ Discord webhook: 5 requests per 5 seconds
- ✅ RPC calls: 50 requests per 10 seconds
- ✅ Per-address cooldown: 60 seconds
- ✅ Automatic backoff on rate limit errors

### 4. Network Security
- ✅ 10-second timeout on all external requests
- ✅ AbortController for request cancellation
- ✅ Error handling without information disclosure
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement for webhooks

### 5. Logging Security
- ✅ Logs stored in secure directory (mode 0700)
- ✅ Log rotation (5 files, 10MB each)
- ✅ Sensitive data sanitization
- ✅ No credentials in error messages

### 6. Memory Management
- ✅ Price history limited to 20 entries
- ✅ Old data cleaned up after 2 hours
- ✅ Transaction cache expires after 5 minutes
- ✅ Periodic garbage collection

### 7. Dependency Security
- ✅ Updated @solana/spl-token to patch vulnerability
- ✅ Using specific versions (no wildcards)
- ✅ Regular audit recommendations

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Regenerate Compromised Credentials
Your credentials have been exposed. You MUST:

1. **Helius RPC API Key**
   - Go to https://www.helius.dev/
   - Delete the old API key
   - Generate a new one
   - Update `.env`

2. **Discord Webhook**
   - Delete the current webhook in Discord settings
   - Create a new webhook
   - Update `.env`

### 2. Secure Your Environment
```bash
# Set secure permissions on .env
chmod 600 .env

# Update dependencies
npm update
npm audit fix

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 3. Best Practices Going Forward
- **Never** commit `.env` files
- **Never** share API keys or webhooks
- Rotate credentials every 90 days
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Monitor logs for security issues
- Keep dependencies updated

## 🛡️ Additional Recommendations

### For Production Deployment:
1. Use a secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
2. Enable application monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)
3. Use a dedicated RPC node
4. Implement IP whitelisting for webhooks
5. Add authentication for configuration changes
6. Use HTTPS for all communications
7. Enable audit logging
8. Implement automated security scanning

### Security Monitoring:
- Check logs regularly: `tail -f logs/nyla-alerts.log`
- Monitor for rate limit errors
- Watch for unusual transaction patterns
- Set up alerts for failed webhook deliveries

## 📞 Security Incident Response
If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately rotate all credentials
2. Review logs for unauthorized access
3. Check Discord for unexpected messages
4. Monitor Helius dashboard for unusual API usage
5. Update the bot and all dependencies

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix!
